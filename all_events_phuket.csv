Stand-up concert by Valery Artyukhov,"Valera Artyukhov's solo concert at Shaman Lounge Bar!

 For the first time in Phuket! On December 11th, Valera Artyukhov will perform on the Shaman Lounge stage. He is a popular stand-up comedian, a resident of the comedy show ""Stand Up"" on TNT, a participant and writer of the show ""Prozharka,"" a participant in the project ""Bolshoy Show"" with Azamat Musagaliev, and a participant in ""Open Mic"" (TNT).

 The comedian admits: ""Generally, I adhere to the rule that comedy should be 50/50. Not super alternative, but also not pop, where you joke about old, tired topics we've all heard somewhere before. But most importantly, I enjoy not the edgy jokes, but the moments when the audience laughs at them. And I enjoy the process itself, finding that fine line where the audience laughs, even though they know it's still edgy, but they embrace it. I want it to be humorous, not offensive.""

 Thursday evening promises to be truly hilarious. Don't miss this exciting event!
